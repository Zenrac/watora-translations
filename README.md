# Watora Translations

Watora is a Music discord bot.<br>
You can translate yourself Watora to your own languages.<br>
You can also correct my spelling mistakes.<br>

## Before trying to translate the bot, this is some things to know :<br><br> 

- You only have to translate the right part of each lines (after `:`)<br><br>

- `\n` in answer are line break<br><br>

- ```{}```in answer are variables that depends of the situation and you aren't supposed to invert the order of the variables <br><br>

- In short : Do not remove the following characters : ``` * ` {} \n``` <br><br>
 
If you have any questions you can DM me on discord (Zenrac#0001), otherwise if you are looking for people to translate together take a look to the channel *#translations-help* on [Watora's offical discord](https://discord.gg/ArJgTpM "Watora's server").<br><br>

Anyway, a special role **Translator** has been added in the server's roles. Some credits are also displayed in the credit command, and maybe other stuffs will be added later.<br><br>
